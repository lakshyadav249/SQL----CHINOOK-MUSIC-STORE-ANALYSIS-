# SQL----CHINOOK-MUSIC-STORE-ANALYSIS-

As a SQL analyst, I contributed to business optimization at Chinook, a digital music store. I leveraged SQL to analyze data within the Chinook database, encompassing customer demographics, employee performance, media inventory, and sales transactions. My insights empowered the marketing team to gain a deeper understanding of their customer base, refine their marketing strategies, and ultimately enhance business performance."
